# DJI Mavic 3 - Improved Version

This is an improved version of the [Mavic 3](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3112310403) and [Mavic 3 Drop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3112312230) mods originally created by [Sam](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198126061865) and [DarkBall](https://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkBall1).  
I've fixed several bugs, added new features, and made it better than the original.

## Usage:
1. **Deploying the Mavic:**
   - With `ItemMavic3` or `Item_Mavic3` in your inventory, open the inventory menu and place the item on the ground to deploy the drone. The Mavic will align with the player's faction.
   - Control the Mavic through the **UAV Terminal** (ensure both the UAV and Terminal are on the same faction: Blufor=NATO, Opfor=CSAT, Independent=AAF, Civilian=Civilians).

2. **Camera Controls:**
   - Press `Ctrl + RMB` to toggle the camera turret control mode, similar to the vanilla AL-6 Utility Drone.

3. **Charging:**
   - Use the item **Laser Battery** via the action menu to charge the Mavic.  
   - For **ACE3 users**, recharge via the **ACE interaction menu** using an ACE UAV Battery.

4. **Retrieving the Mavic:**
   - Land the Mavic, turn off the engine, and perform the "Put Mavic in inventory" action (requires free inventory space).

### Grenade Drops:
- **Attaching Grenades:**  
  Use the "Attach Grenade" action when supported grenades are in your inventory.  
  (Supported grenade types can be customized via the CBA settings).  

- **Dropping Grenades:**  
  Press the default **G** key to release the grenade (keybinding can be changed).

- **Detaching Grenades:**  
  Use the "Detach Grenade" action if the grenade is no longer needed.

## Changes and New Features:
- Enhanced **collision light** with toggleable on/off actions.  
- **Improved sound effects**.  
- Redesigned **HUD** with a new crosshair.  
- Configurable HUD units (speed, distance, height).  
- Integrated **Mavic 3 Drop Mod**.  
- Improved flight model and AI behavior.  
- **Customizable grenade settings** in CBA options.  
- Added **civilian version**.  
- Working **bottom auxiliary light**.  
- New **"Reset Camera Position"** action.  
- **ACE Arsenal** and Eden Editor compatibility.  
- Numerous **bug fixes**, including:  
  - Fixed "can't leave UAV" issue.  
  - Resolved HUD error spams and grenade inventory issues.  
  - Improved grenade drop key compatibility (default key: **G**).  

---

## Future Plans:
- Add more commands (e.g., RTH mode).  
- Fix additional bugs.  
- Implement mute sounds for the Mavic.

---

## Known Issues:
- Attaching "Timed Fuse (Normal) Grenade" may interfere with Mavic interactions.  
- Taking off protection occasionally activates at the wrong time, preventing crash damage (can be disabled in CBA settings).  
- Objects generated by the bottom light can confuse AI, causing them to climb continuously.  
- AI movement at high altitudes may gradually increase.

---

## Notes:
- No changes have been made to the **3D model**.  
- Improvements focus on config and scripts.  

### Compatibility:
This mod is **NOT compatible** with other "Original Mavic 3" related mods or missions due to breaking changes.  

### Localization:
Currently supported languages:  
- English (EN), Japanese (JP), partially Russian (RU).
