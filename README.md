Tips: The UAV Terminal must be on the same side as the player and UAV.

[*]Press Ctrl+RMB to toggle camera turret control mode, like as vanilla Utility Drone (AL-6).
[*]You can charge your Mavic from action menu with using the item "Laser Battery".
If you are using ACE3, you can charge Mavic from ACE interaction with ACE UAV Battery.
[*]If you want to retrieve it, Land the Mavic and turn off engine. Then perform the action "Put Mavic in inventory" (You need free space in your inventory)
[/list]
--- Grenade Drops
[list]
[*]You can attach a grenade to the Mavic by using the "Attach Grenade" action while the supported grenade is in your inventory.
(Type of grenades are can be added at CBA addonOption)

[b]Future Plans:[/b]

[b]Known Issues:[/b]  
I'll fix in feature............maybe.........maybe not?
[list]
[*]When "Timed Fuse (Normal) Grenade" attached to mavic, may interfere with interaction with the Mavic, this making it impossible to select actions such as Attach/Detach grenade and etc.
(You can still can action while inside the drone and operating it)
[*]Landing protection function was sometimes applied at the wrong timing. No damage to occur even when the drone crash hard to ground.
(You can disable this function in addonOption)
[*]Objects generated by bottom light feature cause AI to keep climbing.
[*]When AI moves horizontally, it keeps increasing altitude a little. When it reaches the destination, it drops to the set altitude.

Improvements are focused on config and scripts. I'm not 3D model creator.
